My name is Victor, and I am a newly graduated Student from the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay with a Major in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics. I grew up in Sweden, where I developed interests in hockey, music, video games, and computers. In high school, I was eager to learn how to develop video games, which led me to gain experience with unity, 3D modeling, rigging, skinning, texturing, and animations. My passion for hockey eventually brought me to the United States, where I was given the opportunity to play hockey and study computer science. During college, I had the opportunity to work with a company called Reynolds Packaging through a summer internship. Throughout the internship, I focused on developing software in Java and C and familiarized myself with different communication protocols such as  TCP, UDP, and Modbus.  I am looking forward to being able to put my skills and knowledge to use with companies that create Systems and software that makes life more enjoyable for others.
