My name is Victor, and I am currently an International Student at the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay studying Computer Science and Mathematics. I grew up in Sweden, where I developed interests in hockey, music, video games, and computers. In high school, I was eager to learn how to develop video games, which led me to gain experience with unity, 3D modeling, rigging, skinning, texturing, and animations. My passion for hockey eventually brought me to the United States, where I was given the opportunity to play hockey and study computer science. During college, I had  the opportunity to work with a company called Reynolds Packaging through a summer internship. Throughout the internship, I focused on Java programming, C programming, and modbus to help develop a new software for the company. Now that I am currently finishing my last semester at the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay before graduating in May, I am very excited to have the opportunity to work with companies that create applications to help others.
